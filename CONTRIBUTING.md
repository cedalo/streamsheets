# How to Develop

## As Developer
* Create a branch called `feature/a-useful-name` (use dashes in branch names)
	* For bugfixes use the `bugfix/` prefix
* Make your changes on the feature branch
* Push the feature branch, open a pull request and select a reviewer
* Work with the reviewer to get your pull request approved
* When your pull request is approved, merge it with the ... strategy if possible
* Delete the branch

## As Reviewer
* Give feedback on the propose pull request (positive and negative)
* When all issues are resolved, approve the pull request
* Let the original developer merge the branch
